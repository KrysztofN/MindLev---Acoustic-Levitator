# MindLev---Acoustic-Levitator
Innovative award-winning acoustic levitator. 


In 2023 I created in high school an appliation for acoustic levitation.
The program is deviced-based and will only run after beeing connected to 
a proper devce (USB-UART) for sending crucial information for calculating 
phase shifts which is the basis for acoustic levitation to work. 

The whole pdf file with description of the project will also be available
to download, so if anyone is interested in re-making of the 
project you will find all the neccesarry information there.
